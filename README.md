 ’Designer Hands,’ a 3D hand gesture designing pipeline aimed at
simplifying the gestural interface design process for immersive computing appli-
cations. This tool enables designers to use their bare hands freely to design both
static and dynamic hand gestures and to test and verify them with AR/VR
head-mounted displays (HMDs) without the need to own AR/VR devices in
the early design stages. This approach facilitates rapid prototyping and more
natural hand gesture design, as designers can perform the gestures themselves
and then incorporate them into the design, testing them on different platforms.
This abstract provides a high-level overview of the pipeline, and the full paper
will delve into the design architectures, the use of machine learning models, and
the evaluation of the design with real AR/VR HMDs. We hope DH will attract
many designers to explore gesture interaction designs for immersive computing
applications.
